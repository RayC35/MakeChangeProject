# MakeChangeProject

## Description
This program acts as a cash register. The user inputs both the price of a purchase and the amount tendered. The program will then determine the change (if any) due to the customer, as well as provide the breakdown of the necessary denominations in order to make accurate change. The current included denominations include: twenty dollar bills, ten dollar bills, five dollar bills, one dollar bills, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

## Technologies Used
	* Java
	* Eclipse

## Lessons Learned
This project gave me a clearer understanding of the way in which double types are converted to integer types and the concept of truncation. Maybe the most difficult problem I faced in this project was using and understanding the mod operator, as well as how the remainder can be used. Also, this project highlighted just how easy it is to get lost or confused in my own code, perhaps its just because this is all so new, but I'll need to work out a way to keep things organized.
